'''Pesto''' ({{IPA-it|ˈpesto|lang}}, {{IPA-lij|ˈpestu|lang}}), or to refer to the original dish '''pesto alla genovese''' ({{IPA-it|ˈpesto alla dʒenoˈveːse, -eːze}}), is a [[sauce]] originating in [[Genoa]], the capital city of [[Liguria]], [[Italy]].<ref name="itchefs">{{Cite web|title=Pesto Genovese: an Ageless Benchmark of Great Italian Cuisine|url=http://www.itchefs-gvci.com/?option=com_content&view=article&id=661&Itemid=1030|accessdate=11 October 2011}}</ref> It traditionally consists of crushed [[garlic]], European [[pine nut]]s, coarse salt, [[Basil|basil leaves]], and hard cheese such as [[Parmigiano-Reggiano]] (also known as Parmesan cheese) or [[Pecorino Sardo]] (cheese made from sheep's milk), all blended with [[olive oil]].<ref name="CMPM">{{Cite web|last=Campionato Mondiale Pesto al Mortaio|title=Pesto's official recipe|url=https://www.pestochampionship.it/en/about-pesto/official-championship-recipe.html|accessdate=10 August 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018232331/http://pestochampionship.it/en/about-pesto/official-championship-recipe.html|archivedate=18 October 2011}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name is the past participle of the [[Genoese dialect|Genoese]] verb {{lang|lij|pestâ}} (Italian: {{lang|it|pestare}}), which means "to pound", "to crush", in reference to the original method of preparation: according to tradition, the ingredients are "crushed" or ground in a marble [[Mortar and pestle|mortar]] through a circular motion of a wooden [[Mortar and pestle|pestle]]. This same [[Latin]] root, through [[Old French]], also gave rise to the [[English language|English]] noun ''pestle''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/pesto#etymonline_v_12782|title=pesto|work=Online Etymological Dictionary}}</ref>

Strictly speaking, ''pesto'' is a generic term for anything that is made by pounding; that is why the word is used for several pestos in Italy. Nonetheless, ''pesto alla genovese'' ("Genoese pesto") remains the most popular pesto in Italy and the rest of the world.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pronzati|first=Virgilio|date=2012|title=Come uno specialista di enogastronomia racconta la storia popolare Genovese|trans-title=How a food and wine specialist relates the Genoese folk history|chapter=Si fa presto a dire pesto|trans-chapter=It is one thing to say Pesto|url=http://www.acompagna.org/wit/chisiamo/iniziative/martedi/2011-2012/120320.pdf|location=Genoa|issue=I Martedì dell'associazione "A Compagna"|language=Italian|page=2 }}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:PastaWithPesto.JPG|thumb|[[Trenette]] with pesto.]]

Pesto is thought to have two predecessors in ancient times, going back as far as the [[Roman age]]. The [[Roman age|ancient Romans]] used to eat a similar paste called [[moretum]], which was made by crushing garlic, salt, cheese, herbs, olive oil and vinegar together.<ref name="itchefs"/><ref name="appendix">{{Cite web|title=Moretum – Appendix Vergiliana|url=http://www.virgil.org/appendix/moretum.htm|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> The use of this paste in the Roman cuisine is mentioned in the ''[[Appendix Vergiliana#Moretum ("The Pesto")|Appendix Vergiliana]]'', an ancient collection of poems where the author dwells on the details about the preparation of ''moretum''.<ref name=appendix/> During the [[Middle Ages]], a popular sauce in the Genoan cuisine was ''agliata'', which was basically a mash of garlic and walnuts, as garlic was a staple in the nutrition of Ligurians, especially for the seafarers.<ref name="itchefs"/>

The introduction of basil, the main ingredient of modern pesto, occurred in more recent times and is first documented only in the mid-19th century, when gastronomist Giovanni Battista Ratto published his book ''La Cuciniera Genovese'' in 1863:<ref name="itchefs"/>

<blockquote>"''Take a clove of [[garlic]], [[basil]] or, when that is lacking, [[marjoram]] and [[parsley]], grated [[List of Dutch cheeses|Dutch]] and [[Parmigiano-Reggiano|Parmigiano]] cheese and mix them with [[pine nut]]s and crush it all together in a mortar with a little [[butter]] until reduced to a paste. Then dissolve it with good and abundant [[oil]]. [[Lasagne]] and [[Trofie]] are dressed with this mash, made more liquid by adding a little hot water without salt.
<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ratto|first=Giovanni Battista|title=La Cuciniera Genovese|publisher=Fratelli Pagano|date=1863|location=Genoa}}</ref></blockquote>

Although likely originating from and being domesticated in India,<ref name="McGee">{{Cite book|last=McGee|first=Harold|author-link=Harold McGee|title=[[On Food and Cooking]]: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen|date=2004|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]|location=[[New York, New York]]|isbn=978-0-684-80001-1|lccn=2004058999|oclc=56590708}}</ref> basil took the firmest root in the regions of [[Liguria]], Italy, and [[Provence]], France. It was abundant in this part of Italy, though only when in season, which is why marjoram and parsley are suggested as alternatives when basil is lacking.<ref name="itchefs"/> Ratto mentions Dutch cheese (''formaggio olandese'') instead of [[Pecorino Sardo]] since Northern European cheeses were actually common in Genoa at the time, thanks to the centuries-long commercial trades of the [[Republic of Genoa|maritime republic]].<ref name="itchefs"/>

This recipe for ''pesto alla genovese'' was often revised in the following years (a noted revision by Emanuele Rossi occurred in 1865, only a couple of years after Ratto's ''Cuciniera''),<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rossi|first=Emanuele|title=La vera cuciniera Genovese facile ed economica|date=1865|location=Genoa}}</ref> and it shortly became a staple in the Ligurian culinary tradition, with each family often featuring its own pesto recipe (with slight differences to the traditional ingredients).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zelfpestomaken.nl/|title=Zelf Pesto Maken}}</ref> This is the main reason why pesto recipes often differ from each other.

In 1944, ''[[The New York Times]]'' mentioned an imported canned pesto paste. In 1946, ''[[Sunset (magazine)|Sunset]]'' magazine published a pesto recipe by [[Angelo Pellegrini]]. Pesto did not become popular in North America until the 1980s and 1990s.<ref name="sunsetApril2008">{{Cite news|last=Traverso|first=Amy|title=Pesto's Premiere|newspaper=Sunset|page=116|date=April 2008|url=https://www.sunset.com/sunset/food/article/0,20633,1717438,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513052652/http://www.sunset.com/sunset/food/article/0,20633,1717438,00.html|archivedate=13 May 2008|accessdate=22 July 2008}}</ref>

== Ingredients and preparation ==
Pesto is traditionally prepared in a marble mortar with a wooden pestle. First, garlic and pine nuts are placed in the mortar and reduced to a cream,<ref name=CMPM/> and then the washed and dried basil leaves are added with coarse salt and ground to a creamy consistency. Only then is a mix of Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino added. To help incorporate the cheese a little extra-virgin olive oil is added. In a tight jar (or simply in an air-tight plastic container), covered by a layer of extra-virgin olive oil, pesto can last in the refrigerator up to a week, and can be frozen for later use.<ref name="Consorzio del pesto Genovese recipe">{{Cite web|work=mangiareinliguria.it|url=http://www.mangiareinliguria.it/consorziopestogenovese/pestogenovese.php|title=Consorzio del pesto Genovese recipe|access-date=21 February 2008}}</ref>

Pesto is commonly used on pasta, traditionally with ''mandilli de sæa'' ("silk handkerchiefs" in the Genoese dialect),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mangiareinliguria.it/ita/ricette/ricette_liguria/mandilli_de_saea.php|title=Mangiare in Liguria}}</ref> [[trofie]] or [[trenette]]. Potatoes and string beans are also traditionally added to the dish, boiled in the same pot in which the pasta has been cooked.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} Pasta, mixed with pesto, has become a well-known dish in many countries today, with countless recipes being posted online for "pesto pasta".

It is used in Genovese [[minestrone]]. Outside of Italy, pesto is sometimes served with sliced beef, tomatoes, and sliced boiled potatoes.

=== Variations ===
Pesto comes in a variety of recipes, some traditional and some modern, as the very noun ''pesto'' is a generic term for anything that is made by pounding.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rankin|first=Dottie|title=Very Pesto|publisher=Celestial Arts|isbn=978-1-58761-208-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/verypesto0000rank/page/8 8]|url=https://archive.org/details/verypesto0000rank/page/8}}</ref>

The original ''pesto alla genovese'', the quintessential pesto recipe, is made with [[Genovese basil]], coarse salt, garlic, Ligurian extra virgin olive oil (Taggiasco), European [[pine nut]]s (sometimes toasted) and a grated cheese like [[Parmigiano-Reggiano]] or [[Grana Padano]] and [[Pecorino Sardo]] or [[Pecorino Romano]].<ref name="Consorzio del pesto Genovese recipe"/> A proposal is under preparation by the Palatifini Association to have pesto alla genovese included in the [[UNESCO]] intangible cultural heritage list.<ref name="La Republica, 18 March 2018">[https://genova.repubblica.it/cronaca/2018/03/18/news/in_27_000_firmano_per_il_pesto_patrimonio_unesco-191620898/?refresh_ce La Republica, 18 March, 2018]</ref> There is a biennial international Genovese Pesto al Mortaio competition in which 100 finalists use traditional mortars and pestles as well as the above ingredients which are then assessed by 30 local and international judges.

A slightly different version of this sauce exists in [[Provence]], where it is known as ''[[pistou]]''. In contrast to ''pesto alla genovese'', ''pistou'' is generally made with olive oil, basil and garlic only: while cheese may be added, usually no nuts are included in a traditional ''pistou'' because no pine trees grow there to provide the nuts. ''Pistou'' is used in the typical ''soupe au pistou'', a hearty vegetable soup with ''pistou'' flavour. The sauce did not originally contain basil, however; instead, cheese and olive oil were the main constituents.<ref name="Brennan">{{Cite book|last=Brennan|first=Georgeanna|title=A Pig in Provence: Good Food and Simple Pleasures in the South of France|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=978-0-8118-5213-5|page=156}}</ref>

Outside of Italy, sometimes almonds are used instead of pine nuts, and sometimes [[Mentha|mint]] leaves are mixed in with the basil leaves.<ref name="Brennan" /> It has been pointed out that any combination of flavourful leaves, oily nuts, hard cheese, olive oil, garlic, salt and lemon juice can produce a pesto-like condiment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/01/cheap-food-diy-homemade-ingredients|title=10 best foods to make from scratch and save money|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 February 2016|author=Dale Berning Sawa|accessdate=1 February 2016}}</ref>

''[[Pesto alla trapanese|Pesto alla siciliana]]'', sometimes called ''pesto rosso'' (red pesto), is a sauce from [[Sicily]] similar to ''pesto alla genovese'' but with the addition of tomato and almonds instead of pine nuts, and much less basil.

''Pesto alla calabrese'' is a sauce from [[Calabria]] consisting of (grilled) bell peppers, black pepper and more; these ingredients give it a distinctively spicy taste.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Locatelli|first=Giorgio|title=Made in Sicily|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2011|isbn=978-0-00-745722-9|at=n.p.}}</ref>

Outside Italy, the household name ''pesto'' has been used for all sorts of cold sauces or dips, mostly without any of the original ingredients: [[Eruca sativa|rocket]] (instead of or in addition to basil), black olives, lemon peel, [[coriander]], or mushrooms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.it/|title=Recipes: Mushroom Pesto Crostini|publisher=Food Network}}</ref> In more northern countries, [[Allium ursinum|ramson]] leaves are sometimes used instead of basil.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gewürzmix für Bärlauch Pesto|trans-title=Spice blend for ramsons pesto|url=https://www.gourvita.com/|accessdate=19 July 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130719105526/http://www.gourvita.com/de/gewurzmix-fur-barlauch-pesto.html|archive-date=19 July 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the 19th century, Genovese immigrants to Argentina brought pesto recipes with them. A Peruvian variety, known as ''tallarines verdes'' (meaning "green noodles", from Italian ''tagliarini''), is slightly creamier, lacks pine nuts (because of their rarity and prohibitive cost in Peru), may use spinach and vegetable oil (in place of olive oil), and is sometimes served with roasted potatoes and sirloin steak.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Vegan variations of pesto can include mixes of fresh basil, nuts such as walnut or pine nut, olive oil, and the addition of miso paste and [[nutritional yeast]] to provide additional flavour enhancement to the dish.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Millennium Cookbook: Extraordinary Vegetarian Cuisine|first1=Eric|last1=Tucker|first2=John|last2=Westerdahl|first3=Sascha|last3=Weiss|last-author-amp=yes }}</ref>

== Non-traditional variants of pesto ==
For reasons of expense or availability, walnuts, pecans, cashews or even peanuts are sometimes substituted for the traditional pine nuts. Also, while the nuts are traditionally used as is, some recipes call for prior toasting. While not preferable, other culinary nuts may be used due to the taste disturbances that some people may experience after consuming pine nuts (see [[Pine nut#Taste disturbances|pine mouth]]). Many online recipes in English for pesto will also list [[black pepper]] among the ingredients,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/basil-pesto-recipe2.html|title=Basil Pesto|website=Food Network}}</ref> which the traditional Genoese recipe omits.<ref name="itchefs"/>
Some manufacturers of pesto for European supermarkets also use filling material like potato flakes which, however, also softens the traditionally strong flavour.
Certain pesto recipes abroad replace basil with avocado and parsley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thespruceeats.com/avocado-pesto-dairy-free-recipe-4136749|title=
